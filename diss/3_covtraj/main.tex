\chapter{Localizing Group Differences over
Covariance Trajectories}\label{sec:covtraj}

We will begin with a ``non-deep'' application of Riemannian foundations of differential geometry.
Recent work in graphical models have aimed
to understand the relationship among
features when data is collected from
unique sources, but collected longitudinally.
Building on Riemannian regression schemes,
we present a parametric model for fitting
the progression of variable relationships over time,
and describe theoretical developments
on graphical hypothesis testing,
enabling the identification of 
scientifically important and interesting 
group differences
where classical hypothesis testing
both does not identify meaningful features,
and does not identify unique differences
among known disparate groups of individuals.
The work presented in this chapter was published as a journal article in the Quarterly of Applied Mathematics~\citep{covtraj}.
