\chapter{Localizing Group Differences over Covariance Trajectories}\label{chap:covtraj}

Important feature identification has been well studied 
in classical statistics, and 
we will start here by adapting those
methods directly.
We will see how marrying
methods from differential geometry
and scan statistics enable
identifying meaningful features
that indicate group differences \textit{over time},
that otherwise would be undetectable
given direct applications of classical
approaches.
%Recent work in graphical models has aimed
%to understand the relationship among
%features when data is collected from
%unique sources, but collected longitudinally.
%Building on Riemannian regression schemes,
%we present a parametric model for fitting
%the progression of variable relationships over time.
We describe theoretical developments
on graphical hypothesis testing,
enabling the identification of 
scientifically important and interesting 
group differences
where classical hypothesis testing
both does not identify meaningful features,
and does not identify unique differences
among known disparate groups of individuals.
The work presented in this chapter was published as a journal article in the Quarterly of Applied Mathematics~\citep{covtraj}.
