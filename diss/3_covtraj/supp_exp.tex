\subsection*{Detailed Imaging with Cognitive Tests Results}
In the following tables we provide additional details of the statistical test we performed on the preclinical AD cohort. Each set contains a set of features found to display significant group difference (at the $p \leq 0.05$ level) along the covariance trajectory divided by the group variable indicated.

While some of these associations are well-known, few have been indicated as novel by AD researchers and clinicians, and to be of interesting value for further analysis. 
%Even though it is possible that these subsets are supersets of the true feature set, traditional modeling methods may provide additional insight now that the number of features to be considered has been reduced significantly.

%\subsubsection*{Motivating examples to seek group differences in temporal trends}
%In Figure \ref{fig:imagehists} we present histograms detailing the distribution of two critical cognitive tests, stratified across various groups of scientific interest. These distributions were the key motivation for our exploration into the methods described in the paper, as is demonstrated by the small differences in mean across groups regardless of grouping selection, and the saturation that occurs at the ceiling of the cognitive tests because of the high cognition overall across the cohort.
