Foundations of our work can be traced back to fundamental developments made by Ulf Grenander across fields of study. Early work with Rosenblatt on the analysis of stochastic processes and time series first brought to light
the fundamental issues of linear modeling in Euclidean space, and demonstrated that in many cases it is necessary to develop methods that take explicit advantage of the inherent structure within data \citep{grenander1957statistical}.
Further pioneering work on the statistical analysis on Lie groups \citep{grenander2008probabilities} provides the basis of the Riemannian statistics mentioned above.
Modern hypothesis testing of these structured, manifold-valued data in image analysis is built upon the his joint work \citep{grenander1998computational}. Here, we marry modern developments in these areas, using recent strides in linear model fitting on manifolds and statistical testing of structured data to develop groupwise testing procedures for longitudinal covariances.
