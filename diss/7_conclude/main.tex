\chapter{Follow-up and Future work}\label{chap:discuss}

The work presented here has been and continues 
to be extended in a number of different theoretical 
and empirical directions.
Earlier work has already been leveraged in published work,
and more recent chapters
have led to interesting
continuing avenues of research.

\section{Analyzing Disease Trends in Functional MRI via Covariance Trajectories}

Work in Chapters~\ref{chap:covtraj} and \ref{chap:ott} has been further developed for a number of other applications.
Ideas have contributed
to the understanding and modeling of uncertainty
in recurrent models~\citep{spgru},
and more generally towards efficient
Bayesian methods for deep Monte Carlo methods~\citep{mcreparam}.
Applications based on modeling disease progression
as a function of both static and time-varying 
variables was extended to ``deepify-ing" mixed effects models~\citep{deepmem}.

More directly, the covariance trajectory analysis
methods have been extended 
to the analysis of other Alzheimer's Disease populations~\citep{isbi},
and work on understanding and localizing temporal lobe epilepsy
measured over resting-state functional MRI acquisitions is under review.

\subsection{Brain Network Abnormalities in Alzheimer's Disease}
Rs-fMRI has been shown to be a valuable neuroimaging modality to study the pathophysiological mechanisms and effects of Alzheimer's Disease. 
However, most existing brain network modeling frameworks for rs-fMRI often do not account for the combined statistical and temporal dependencies underlying dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in a statistically robust manner, 
which may be limiting our understanding of altered brain organization in disease.
To address these issues, in this work we demonstrate that
the covariance trajectory methods above can characterize dFC as covariance trajectories on the Riemannian manifold.

In this follow-up work,
we leverage a different setup of the trajectory analysis in Chapter~\ref{chap:covtraj}. Here,
we have a much larger number of timepoints:
compared to patient site visits,
we have functional MRI measurements
occurring at a rate of approximately once per second for scans ranging from 5 to 10 minutes.
While the methods above can be applied,
the computational cost, while not exponential,
still grows at a rate infeasible 
for this application.

To address this, we construct a ``windowed" approach, where we set specific window sizes and stride lengths such that our trajectory spans the length of the scan,
and smoothly estimates the continuous trajectory through overlapping samples.
We fit the trajectories for each subject and take corresponding means for the likelihood statistics and follow the hypothesis testing as above.
Experimental results demonstrated that the approach is capable of identifying differential effects in large-scale functional networks altered in Alzheimer's Disease in a way that overcomes statistical challenges common with many neuroimaging studies.

\subsection{Characterizing the Epilepsy Connectome}
Building on the developments adapting these methods to functional MRI,
we deploy and extend the windowed-approaches
to the study of temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE),
where disease signals are known to
cause widespread disruptions in connectivity dynamics within the well-studied epileptogenic network, 
but it is not yet clear if and to what extent other networks are perturbed in TLE.

Experimentally, we demonstrate that the approach identifies distinct subsets of temporally evolving connectivity features that stratify TLE patients and healthy controls, which map to altered connectivity at the network-scale.

\section{Interpretability and Conditional Independence In Deep Latent Spaces}\label{sec:latents}
\todo{ongoing/future work on latent spaces and condindep}
Work in unlearning in Chapter~\ref{chap:lcodec} is relatively nascent,
but excitement in the field is growing
and a number of works have been motivated
by recent successes.
Methods for directly measuring, and perhaps
even promoting or reducing conditional
independence are beginning to be explored.
Building upon these ideas,
we briefly describe a particular 
direction of interest, motivated
by the recent large successes of large language models.
