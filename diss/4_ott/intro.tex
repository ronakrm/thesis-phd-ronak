\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Recurrent Neural networks (RNNs) and its variants are the de facto 
tool of choice 
for modeling sequential data in machine learning and vision.
%For high-dimensional data, a large problem initially faced by these models included exploding/vanishing gradients. 
But until only recently, these models have been limited in their ability to model high-dimensional data.
Part of the reason is that recurrent structures often lead to large model sizes dependent on sequence length, and thus also require an equivalent amount of increased computation.
While RNNs have been successfully applied to video data in some cases, the strategy 
requires problem specific innovations because of the large mapping necessary 
from inputs to hidden representations. It is fair to say that the growth 
in the number of model parameters in various types of 
recurrent models remains a bottleneck for high 
dimensional datasets.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), on the other hand, 
%better suited at 
handle high dimensional data
%Modern deep learning architectures now almost exclusively use Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) %to alleviate this issue. 
%CNNs, partly due to how most networks in broad use today are set up,
far better and 
can reduce the dimension of an input significantly by deriving rich feature maps. Most computer vision tasks involve some form of a CNN within the architecture, but incorporating CNNs within recurrent structures 
seamlessly to mitigate the RNN specific model size issues described above is not always straightforward.
Notice that a direct replacement of input and output layers with CNNs
leads to a shrinkage of the sequence length considerably \citep{srivastava2015unsupervised},
and pre-training CNN layers may lead to poor local minima
when we train without using an end-to-end pipeline \citep{donahue2015long}.
Some recent works suggest the use of dilated convolutional networks 
for sequence modeling \citep{yu2015multi} to partly mitigate these issues, but this line of work is still developing \citep{zhenIccv2019}. 
%A similar issue exists with other 
For model-size reduction, both for RNN style networks and otherwise, 
PCA or random projections \citep{ye2005two,bingham2001random} style ``compression" ideas have 
also been used with varying degrees of success.

by a given network, a surrogate for the actual ``size'' of the architecture, 
is provided by tensor methods.

Tensor decomposition based methods have recently been shown to enable low dimensional representations of very high dimensional data \citep{hwangCvpr18}, 
and while these ideas were known to be effective in the ``shallow" regime much earlier, new results also demonstrate their applicability for deep neural 
networks. 
In particular, a number of tensor based methods have been successfully adapted for deep neural network design and compression \citep{cohen2016expressive,zhang2017tucker,yu2017compressing,xiong2019antnets}.
Specifically, \cite{pmlr-v70-yang17e} shows that these methods can be very effective in reducing the parameter cost of weight layers in RNNs, enabling simple video analysis tasks that previously would have been computationally prohibitive.

There are a number of key reasons why the size of the model, especially in the context of formulations for sequential data, is central here. Our goal is to design rich sequential or recurrent models to analyze a longitudinal sequence of high dimensional 3D brain images. 
This task raises two issues. \textbf{First}, 
unless the model size is parsimonious, we find that merely instantiating the 
model with data involving 3D images over multiple time points, even on multiple high end GPU instances, is challenging.
\textbf{Second}, 
the eventual goal of medical image analysis is either scientific discovery or generating 
actionable knowledge for patients. 
Both goals require evaluating a model's confidence via 
classical or contemporary statistical techniques: for instance, how confident is the model in its prediction?  
Most, if not all, available tools for assessing 
model uncertainty of deep neural network models 
have a strong dependence on the number of parameters in 
the model. Therefore, even if the first issue above could be mitigated by clever implementation ideas, purely as a practical 
matter, the design of rich and expressive models with a small number of parameters yields immense benefits for calculating model uncertainty.

Here,
we tackle the problem of modeling 
sequential 3D brain imaging data using 
recurrent/sequential models. 
Our development starts from well known results on tensor decomposition. In particular, we 
make use of the tensor train representation, which has been shown to be effective in several 
applications in vision and machine learning. We derive a reformulation of the decomposition using 
orthogonality constraints and show that while this makes the estimation slightly more challenging, 
it \textbf{reduces the number of parameters by as much as half}. 
We present a novel parameter estimation scheme based on Stiefel manifold optimization and demonstrate 
how the end to end construction yields benefits for convergence and uncertainty estimation. 
Finally, from the empirical side, we discuss how we enable analysis of and prediction using sequential 3D brain imaging datasets, which to our knowledge is the first such result using 
deep recurrent architectures.
