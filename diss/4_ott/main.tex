\chapter{Enabling Temporal Neural Networks via Geometric Tensor Representations} \label{chap:ott} 

The above statistical methods work well with
multivariate types of data and scale reasonably well with many features.
However,
even though we have a linear time scanning procedure,
if the number of features reaches thousands or more,
computational feasibility can still be an issue.
Particularly when we are not dealing with
imaging summaries,
using the explicit pixel or voxel-level
data is still intractable.
In these cases,
deep learning methods have
proven to be extremely effective
in modeling high-dimensional data.
Compbined with methods
for temporal modeling,
some success has been seen
in modeling imaging trajectories.
However, a separate problem
emerges: the \textbf{model size}
grows very large, linearly 
in the length of the temporal sequence of interest.
In this chapter, we examine
a novel tensor decomposition
that reduces this model size,
enabling the modeling of high-dimensional
temporal medical imaging data
with reasonable computational resources.
Work in this chapter originally appeared in
the International Conference on Computer Vision~\citep{ott}.
