\section{Graphs and Conditional Independence}

A graph G, edges E, vertices V

undirected graphs
random variables X
markov property/blanket

conditional independence generally

for samples from distributions, can we estimate conditional indep?

If there are some assumptions on XYZ, yes...
conditional gaussian

extending this to an arbitrary query and conditioning sets...multidim

with some assumptions, methods exist
glasso, others
precision matrix, l1 reg

what if we have no distributional asssumptions?
other methods exist for other distributions, and sbms...

recent work...CODEC, 
indep, pairwise, extends/compares to measures of correlation

cond ind, measure similarly:
cont.
sample.

Identifying the full cond indep set: FOCI, 
can be used for building full ``coherent" graphs, see last chapter for more.

\subsection{Hypothesis Testing}
\begin{verbatim}
basics
    form
    measures
    continuous, traditionally want "gap" to be at least "alpha" large
    example: means

some of the measures described above have specific guarantees when evaluated under standard hypothesis testing frameworks...

a common test: likelihood ratio...

scan statistics
\end{verbatim}

\section{Deep Networks, Optimization, and Objectives}
\begin{verbatim}
networks
    objective
how to minimize?
    general optimization?
    gradients
    stochastic grad

NNs aside, lets go back to simple formulations where things are nicer...
linear programming
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Optimal Transport}
    OT can be framed as a linear program....
