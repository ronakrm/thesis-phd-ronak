\chapter{Background}\label{sec:bknd}

Here we will briefly describe some background concepts and ideas that will aid and facilitate discussion of subset identification in later chapters.

\section{General Notations}
The following notations will be standard and followed consistently throughout the sequel, unless otherwise noted.
\begin{itemize}
\item Calligraphic capital letters will typically represent spaces, and capital letters will typically represent an instance or element from those spaces.

\item Set sizes will typically take the form of lowercase $n,d,p$, generally associated with the number of samples, the dimension of some feature space, and the number of parameters respectively. $i,j,k$ will be used for indexing various sets within context.

\item We use $\RR^d$ to represent $d$-dimensional vector space over the reals, and vectors will be lowercase typically as $x,y,z$ and matrices and higher order tensors will be denoted in uppercase, with local clarity on their distinction between a set instance.

\item $S$ will denote a of training examples.
A sample $s_i\in S$ may be indexed by $i \in [1,\ldots,n]$. 
For general and generative settings, $x_i$ may be used in place, and for predictive settings will be represented by the tuple $s_i:=(x_i,y_i)$.

\end{itemize}

\section{Differential Geometry}

\subsection{The Geometry of Tensors}

tensors, multiindexing, tensor decompositions

\section{Graphs and Conditional Independence}

Graphs $G \in \cG$ will generally be defined by their vertex and edge sets $G:=(E,V)$.

\begin{verbatim}
A graph G, edges E, vertices V

undirected graphs
random variables X
markov property/blanket

conditional independence generally

for samples from distributions, can we estimate conditional indep?

If there are some assumptions on XYZ, yes...
conditional gaussian

extending this to an arbitrary query and conditioning sets...multidim

with some assumptions, methods exist
glasso, others
precision matrix, l1 reg

what if we have no distributional asssumptions?
other methods exist for other distributions, and sbms...

recent work...CODEC, 
indep, pairwise, extends/compares to measures of correlation

cond ind, measure similarly:
cont.
sample.

Identifying the full cond indep set: FOCI, 
can be used for building full ``coherent" graphs, see last chapter for more.
    
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Hypothesis Testing}
\begin{verbatim}
basics
    form
    measures
    continuous, traditionally want "gap" to be at least "alpha" large
    example: means

some of the measures described above have specific 
guarantees when evaluated under
standard hypothesis testing frameworks...

a common test: likelihood ratio...

scan statistics
\end{verbatim}

\section{Deep Networks, Optimization, and Objectives}
\begin{verbatim}
networks
    objective
how to minimize?
    general optimization?
    gradients
    stochastic grad

NNs aside, lets go back to simple formulations where things are nicer...
linear programming
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Optimal Transport}
\begin{verbatim}
    OT can be framed as a linear program....
\end{verbatim}
