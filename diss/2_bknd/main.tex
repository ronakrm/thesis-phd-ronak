\chapter{Background}\label{sec:bknd}

Here we will briefly describe some background concepts and ideas that will aid and facilitate discussion of subset identification in later chapters.

\section{General Notations}
The following notations will be standard and followed consistently throughout the sequel, unless otherwise noted.
\begin{itemize}
\item Calligraphic capital letters will typically represent spaces, and capital letters will typically represent an instance or element from those spaces.

\item Set sizes will typically take the form of lowercase $n,d,p$, generally associated with the number of samples, the dimension of some feature space, and the number of parameters respectively. $i,j,k$ will be used for indexing various sets within context.

\item We use $\RR^d$ to represent $d$-dimensional vector space over the reals, and vectors will be lowercase typically as $x,y,z$ and matrices and higher order tensors will be denoted in uppercase, with local clarity on their distinction between a set instance.

\item $S$ will denote a of training examples.
A sample $s_i\in S$ may be indexed by $i \in [1,\ldots,n]$. 
For general and generative settings, $x_i$ may be used in place, and for predictive settings will be represented by the tuple $s_i:=(x_i,y_i)$.
